## Synopsis

This is a basic Registration form created with React and TypeScript

## Basic Commands

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

## Approach to Solution

* This project is created with React as it is just a JS library and not a full framework, which is well suited for this particular project.
* It uses Context API to share data between components. Context API is well suited for this project instead using an explicit state-management 
external dependency like Redux. 

## Possible Improvements
* Could use a css preprocessor like Sass to better handle styles (did not use here as the styles where relatively straigth-forward).
* Add SSR to the app to render the initial page on server side.
* Improve tests quality with better and more robust test cases.
